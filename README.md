# Shoes Store App

This is an e-commerce website for showing and selling shoes online. It has a role-based access system with three roles: guest, user, and admin. The project was built with a microservices architecture, upgraded from the old client-server model. It also has a log search system using Kibana, Elasticsearch, and Logstash, which help to monitor the system easily. A new feature is an AI chat assistant that helps users find products faster.
